‚Äº CVE-2023-32751 ‚Äº

Pydio Cells through 4.1.2 allows XSS. Pydio Cells implements the download of files using presigned URLs which are generated using the Amazon AWS SDK for JavaScript [1]. The secrets used to sign these URLs are hardcoded and exposed through the JavaScript files of the web application. Therefore, it is possible to generate valid signatures for arbitrary download URLs. By uploading an HTML file and modifying the download URL to serve the file inline instead of as an attachment, any included JavaScript code is executed when the URL is opened in a browser, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

It's not often that a zero-day vulnerability causes a network security vendor to urge customers to physically remove and decommission an entire line of affected hardware -- as opposed to just applying software updates. But experts say that is exactly what transpired this week with Barracuda Networks, as the company struggled to combat a sprawling malware threat which appears to have undermined its email security appliances in such a fundamental way that they can no longer be safely updated with software fixes.

‚Äº CVE-2023-34103 ‚Äº

Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. In affected versions some avo fields are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) when rendering html based content. Attackers do need form edit privilege in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, but the results are stored and no specific timing is required. This issue has been addressed in commit `7891c01e` which is expected to be included in the next release of avo. Users are advised to configure CSP headers for their application and to limit untrusted user access as a mitigation.

In Progress MOVEit Transfer before 2021.0.6 (13.0.6), 2021.1.4 (13.1.4), 2022.0.4 (14.0.4), 2022.1.5 (14.1.5), and 2023.0.1 (15.0.1), a SQL injection vulnerability has been found in the MOVEit Transfer web application that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to MOVEit Transfer's database. Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database, and execute SQL statements that alter or delete database elements. NOTE: this is exploited in the wild in May and June 2023; exploitation of unpatched systems can occur via HTTP or HTTPS.
