<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2023-0026 ‼

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When a BGP update message is received over an established BGP session, and that message contains a specific, optional transitive attribute, this session will be torn down with an update message error. This issue cannot propagate beyond an affected system as the processing error occurs as soon as the update is received. This issue is exploitable remotely as the respective attribute can propagate through unaffected systems and intermediate AS (if any). Continuous receipt of a BGP update containing this attribute will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Some customers have experienced these BGP session flaps which prompted Juniper SIRT to release this advisory out of cycle before fixed releases are widely available as there is an effective workaround. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 15.1R1 and later versions prior to 20.4R3-S8; 21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions prior to 21.2R3-S6; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2; 22.3 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1, 22.4R3; 23.1 versions prior to 23.1R1-S1, 23.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8-EVO; 21.1 version 21.1R1-EVO and later versions prior to 21.2R3-S6-EVO; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5-EVO; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4-EVO; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S4-EVO; 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S2-EVO; 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2-EVO, 22.3R3-S1-EVO; 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2-S1-EVO, 22.4R3-EVO; 23.1 versions prior to 23.1R1-S1-EVO, 23.1R2-EVO.

‼ CVE-2023-32751 ‼

Pydio Cells through 4.1.2 allows XSS. Pydio Cells implements the download of files using presigned URLs which are generated using the Amazon AWS SDK for JavaScript [1]. The secrets used to sign these URLs are hardcoded and exposed through the JavaScript files of the web application. Therefore, it is possible to generate valid signatures for arbitrary download URLs. By uploading an HTML file and modifying the download URL to serve the file inline instead of as an attachment, any included JavaScript code is executed when the URL is opened in a browser, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

♟️ Barracuda Urges Replacing — Not Patching — Its Email Security Gateways ♟️

It's not often that a zero-day vulnerability causes a network security vendor to urge customers to physically remove and decommission an entire line of affected hardware -- as opposed to just applying software updates. But experts say that is exactly what transpired this week with Barracuda Networks, as the company struggled to combat a sprawling malware threat which appears to have undermined its email security appliances in such a fundamental way that they can no longer be safely updated with software fixes.

‼ CVE-2023-34103 ‼

Avo is an open source ruby on rails admin panel creation framework. In affected versions some avo fields are vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) when rendering html based content. Attackers do need form edit privilege in order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, but the results are stored and no specific timing is required. This issue has been addressed in commit `7891c01e` which is expected to be included in the next release of avo. Users are advised to configure CSP headers for their application and to limit untrusted user access as a mitigation.
