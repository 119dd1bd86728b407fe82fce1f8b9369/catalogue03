Tel Aviv, Israel â€“ August 2, 2023Â â€“Â Guardio, a cybersecurity company leveraging cutting-edge machine learning and proprietary algorithms to deliver top-tier security solutions for both consumers and SMBs, is releasing today a report detailing their research teamâ€™s discovery of a sophisticated email phishing campaign exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Salesforceâ€™s legitimate email services and SMTP servers. The vulnerability allowed threat actors to craft targeted phishing emails, cleverly evading conventional detection methods by leveraging Salesforceâ€™s domain and reputation and exploiting legacy quirks in Facebookâ€™s web games platform.

In case Cacheservice was configured to use a sproxyd object-storage backend, it would follow HTTP redirects issued by that backend.
