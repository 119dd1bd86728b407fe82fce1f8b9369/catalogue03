<blockquote>
‼ CVE-2023-43794 ‼

Nocodb is an open source Airtable alternative. Affected versions of nocodb contain a SQL injection vulnerability, that allows an authenticated attacker with creator access to query the underlying database. By supplying a specially crafted payload to the given an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to be executed. Since this is a blind SQL injection, an attacker may need to use time-based payloads which would include a function to delay execution for a given number of seconds. The response time indicates, whether the result of the query execution was true or false. Depending on the result, the HTTP response will be returned after a given number of seconds, indicating TRUE, or immediately, indicating FALSE. In that way, an attacker can reveal the data present in the database. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.111.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-141`.

‼ CVE-2023-43658 ‼

dicourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform which adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post of a topic. Improper escaping of event titles could lead to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) within the 'email preview' UI when a site has CSP disabled. Having CSP disabled is a non-default configuration, so the vast majority of sites are unaffected. This problem is resolved in the latest version of the discourse-calendar plugin. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure CSP is enabled on the forum.

‼ CVE-2023-45144 ‼

com.xwiki.identity-oauth:identity-oauth-ui is a package to aid in building identity and service providers based on OAuth authorizations. When a user logs in via the OAuth method, the identityOAuth parameters sent in the GET request is vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS) and XWiki syntax injection. This allows remote code execution via the groovy macro and thus affects the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. The issue has been fixed in Identity OAuth version 1.6. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability and users are advised to upgrade.

‼ CVE-2023-45683 ‼

github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In affected versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI according to the SAML binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at the end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform any authenticated action as the victim once the victimâ€™s browser loaded the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider. Note: SP registration is commonly an unrestricted operation in IdPs, hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible to ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.14. Users unable to upgrade may perform external validation of URLs provided in SAML metadata, or restrict the ability for end-users to upload arbitrary metadata.

The FPC heap memory can be monitored using the CLI command &quot;show chassis fpc&quot;.The following syslog messages can be observed if the respective filter derived from a flow-route cannot be installed.expr_dfw_sfm_range_add:661 SFM packet-length Unable to get a sfm entry for updating the hwexpr_dfw_hw_sfm_add:750 Unable to add the filter secondarymatch to the hardwareexpr_dfw_base_hw_add:52 Failed to add h/w sfm data.expr_dfw_base_hw_create:114 Failed to add h/w data.expr_dfw_base_pfe_inst_create:241 Failed to create base inst for sfilter 0 on PFE 0 for __flowspec_default_inet__expr_dfw_flt_inst_change:1368 Failed to create __flowspec_default_inet__ on PFE 0expr_dfw_hw_pgm_fnum:465 dfw_pfe_inst_old not found for pfe_index 0!expr_dfw_bp_pgm_flt_num:548 Failed to pgm bind-point in hw: generic failureexpr_dfw_bp_topo_handler:1102 Failed to program fnum.expr_dfw_entry_process_change:679 Failed to change instance for filter __flowspec_default_inet__.This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS:on PTX1000, PTX10002, and PTX10004, PTX10008 and PTX10016 with LC110x FPCs: * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S5; * 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4; * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-S2, 21.4R3; * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R1-S2, 22.1R2.on PTX3000, PTX5000, QFX10000: * All versions prior to 20.4R3-S8; * 21.1 version 21.1R1 and later versions; * 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S6; * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5; * 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3-S4; * 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S3 * 22.2 versions prior to 22.2R3-S1 * 22.3 versions prior to 22.3R2-S2, 22.3R3 * 22.4 versions prior to 22.4R2.

‼ CVE-2023-44392 ‼

Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing. Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with `test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results. These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command `garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the `ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are available.

‼ CVE-2023-44393 ‼

Piwigo is an open source photo gallery application. Prior to version 14.0.0beta4, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is in the` /admin.php?page&#61;plugins&amp;tab&#61;new&amp;installstatus&#61;ok&amp;plugin_id&#61;[here]` page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page, which could then be executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload. The vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id` value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an administrator visits this URL, the malicious code will be injected into the HTML page and executed. This vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However, only users who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the vulnerability is only present on the `/admin.php?page&#61;plugins&amp;tab&#61;new&amp;installstatus&#61;ok&amp;plugin_id&#61;[here]` page, which is only accessible to administrators. Version 14.0.0.beta4 contains a patch for this issue.

AntiSamy is a library for performing fast, configurable cleansing of HTML coming from untrusted sources. Prior to version 1.7.4, there is a potential for a mutation XSS (mXSS) vulnerability in AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be enabled in your policy file and also allow for certain tags at the same time. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's sanitized output. This issue has been patched in AntiSamy 1.7.4 and later.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support for multi-language development. In some cases, when Gradle parses XML files, resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with an Out Of Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to exfiltration of local text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML files for several purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files it generated or were already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors and Maven POM files can be fetched from remote repositories and parsed by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities has been disabled for all use cases to protect against this vulnerability.
