♦️In this video I showed you how to find SQL Injection bug and access the admin Login. First I had only web address with the help of dorks I found paths and directory for the vulnerable page. Then I simply use some small technique to find SQL Bug. After Finding bug I just found the column and vulnerable column. Then I inject my tools to get admin login.
