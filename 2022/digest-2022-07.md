HumHub is an Open Source Enterprise Social Network. Affected versions of HumHub are vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, the attacker would need a permission to administer the Spaces feature. The names of individual &quot;spaces&quot; are not properly escaped and so an attacker with sufficient privilege could insert malicious javascript into a space name and exploit system users who visit that space. It is recommended that the HumHub is upgraded to 1.11.4, 1.10.5. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

‼ CVE-2022-34265 ‼

An issue was discovered in Django 3.2 before 3.2.14 and 4.0 before 4.0.6. The Trunc() and Extract() database functions are subject to SQL injection if untrusted data is used as a kind/lookup_name value. Applications that constrain the lookup name and kind choice to a known safe list are unaffected.

‼ CVE-2022-33171 ‼

** DISPUTED ** The findOne function in TypeORM before 0.3.0 can either be supplied with a string or a FindOneOptions object. When input to the function is a user-controlled parsed JSON object, supplying a crafted FindOneOptions instead of an id string leads to SQL injection. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the user's application is responsible for input validation.
