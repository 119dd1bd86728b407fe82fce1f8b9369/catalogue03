<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-31197 ‚Äº

PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (PgJDBC for short) allows Java programs to connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent Java code. The PGJDBC implementation of the `java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user. User applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method are not impacted. User application that do invoke that method are impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet. Note that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to execute commands as the privileged user. Patched versions will be released as `42.2.26` and `42.4.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

‚Äº CVE-2022-35918 ‚Äº

Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for python. Users hosting Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are vulnerable to a directory traversal attack that could leak data from their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable files, and potentially other sensitive information. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would process that URL and return the contents of that file or overwrite existing files on the web-server. This issue has been resolved in version 1.11.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-31195 ‚Äº

DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides durable access to digital resources. In affected versions the ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability. This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to /admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path &quot;/xmlui&quot;, then you'd need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path &quot;/jspui&quot;, then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be impacted by this vulnerability.

Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Versions prior to 1.5.8 were found to be subject to code injection on windows. This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape arguments for cmd.exe on Windows An attacker can omit all arguments following their input by including a line feed character (`'\n'`) in the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line feed characters (`'\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-31109 ‚Äº

laminas-diactoros is a PHP package containing implementations of the PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces and PSR-17 HTTP message factory interfaces. Applications that use Diactoros, and are either not behind a proxy, or can be accessed via untrusted proxies, can potentially have the host, protocol, and/or port of a `Laminas\Diactoros\Uri` instance associated with the incoming server request modified to reflect values from `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Such changes can potentially lead to XSS attacks (if a fully-qualified URL is used in links) and/or URL poisoning. Since the `X-Forwarded-*` headers do have valid use cases, particularly in clustered environments using a load balancer, the library offers mitigation measures only in the v2 releases, as doing otherwise would break these use cases immediately. Users of v2 releases from 2.11.1 can provide an additional argument to `Laminas\Diactoros\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals()` in the form of a `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\RequestFilterInterface` instance, including the shipped `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\NoOpRequestFilter` implementation which ignores the `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Starting in version 3.0, the library will reverse behavior to use the `NoOpRequestFilter` by default, and require users to opt-in to `X-Forwarded-*` header usage via a configured `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\LegacyXForwardedHeaderFilter` instance. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.11.1 or later to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may configure web servers to reject `X-Forwarded-*` headers at the web server level.
