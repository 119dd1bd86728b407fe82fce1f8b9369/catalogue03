<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-39207 ‚Äº

Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server. This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

<blockquote>
‚Äº CVE-2022-36020 ‚Äº

The typo3/html-sanitizer package is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package `masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with special HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16 of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

‚Äã‚ÄãSiofra 

A tool designed to identify and exploit DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in Windows programs. It is able to simulate the Windows loader in order to give visibility into all of the dependencies (and corresponding vulnerabilities) of a PE on disk, or alternatively an image file in memory corresponding to an active process. More significantly, the tool has the ability to easily generate DLLs to exploit these types of vulnerabilities via PE infection with dynamic shellcode creation. 

These infected DLLs retain the code (DllMain, exported functions) as well as the resources of a DLL to seamlessly preserve the functionality of the application loading them, while at the same time allowing the researcher to specify an executable payload to be either run as a separate process or loaded into the target as a module. Additionally, the tool contains automated methods of combining UAC auto-elevation criteria with the aforementioned functionality in order to scan for UAC bypass vulnerabilities.
