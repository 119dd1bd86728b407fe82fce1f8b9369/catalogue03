â€‹â€‹Siofra 

A tool designed to identify and exploit DLL hijacking vulnerabilities in Windows programs. It is able to simulate the Windows loader in order to give visibility into all of the dependencies (and corresponding vulnerabilities) of a PE on disk, or alternatively an image file in memory corresponding to an active process. More significantly, the tool has the ability to easily generate DLLs to exploit these types of vulnerabilities via PE infection with dynamic shellcode creation. 

These infected DLLs retain the code (DllMain, exported functions) as well as the resources of a DLL to seamlessly preserve the functionality of the application loading them, while at the same time allowing the researcher to specify an executable payload to be either run as a separate process or loaded into the target as a module. Additionally, the tool contains automated methods of combining UAC auto-elevation criteria with the aforementioned functionality in order to scan for UAC bypass vulnerabilities.
