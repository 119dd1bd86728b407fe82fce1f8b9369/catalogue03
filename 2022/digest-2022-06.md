This may be done via application configuration:```ruby&#35; In config/application.rbconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags &#61; [&quot;select&quot;, &quot;style&quot;]```see https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html&#35;configuring-action-viewOr it may be done with a `:tags` option to the Action View helper `sanitize`:```&lt;%&#61; sanitize @comment.body, tags: [&quot;select&quot;, &quot;style&quot;] %&gt;```see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/SanitizeHelper.html&#35;method-i-sanitizeOr it may be done with Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer directly:```ruby&#35; class-level optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags &#61; [&quot;select&quot;, &quot;style&quot;]```or```ruby&#35; instance-level optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags: [&quot;select&quot;, &quot;style&quot;])```All users overriding the allowed tags by any of the above mechanisms to include both &quot;select&quot; and &quot;style&quot; should either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.&#35;&#35; ReleasesThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.&#35;&#35; WorkaroundsRemove either `select` or `style` from the overridden allowed tags.&#35;&#35; CreditsThis vulnerability was responsibly reported by [windshock](https://hackerone.com/windshock?type&#61;user).

This vulnerability only affects sites which have modified or disabled DiscourseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s default Content Security Policy. This issue is patched in version 1.0.1 of the Discourse Calendar plugin. As a workaround, ensure that the Content Security Policy is enabled, and has not been modified in a way which would make it more vulnerable to XSS attacks.

This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.29. The overflowed data leads to segmentation fault and ultimately a denial-of-service condition, causing the device to reboot. The impact of this vulnerability is that an unauthenticated attacker could leverage this flaw to cause the target device to become unresponsive. An attacker could automate this attack to achieve persistent DoS, effectively rendering the target controller useless.

The injected commands only get executed during start up or when unsafe calls regarding the hostname are used. This allows the attacker to gain remote access to the device and can make their persistence permanent by modifying the filesystem.

‼ CVE-2022-24848 ‼

DHIS2 is an information system for data capture, management, validation, analytics and visualization. A SQL injection security vulnerability affects the `/api/programs/orgUnits?programs&#61;` API endpoint in DHIS2 versions prior to 2.36.10.1 and 2.37.6.1. The system is vulnerable to attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2, and there is no known way of exploiting the vulnerability without first being logged in as a DHIS2 user. The vulnerability is not exposed to a non-malicious user and requires a conscious attack to be exploited. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow the malicious user to read, edit and delete data in the DHIS2 instance's database. Security patches are now available for DHIS2 versions 2.36.10.1 and 2.37.6.1. One may apply mitigations at the web proxy level as a workaround. More information about these mitigations is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.
